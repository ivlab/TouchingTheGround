2D,101,The color is very helpful in the background., I often misread the direction of slope with contours alone.,"For the comparison task, I will rule out the most impossible option first and make the comparison simpler. For the path intersection task, I use the mouse to follow the path I was imaging."
Physical,101,I can easily find the peak and the valley,It is very difficult to judge the absolute height of a point.,I will try to look from the side so that I can better refer to the height reference on the right.
VR,101,I can easily manipulate the 3d model.,The legend does not move with the model. I feels like it makes me harder to judge the height.,I used the same strategies in the physical condition. But I rotate the model more here because it is easier. This kind of exploration gives me a lot of information.
Physical,102,there is a metric that I can move to see the max/min height. Hear confirmation of getting the practice round correct. ,"uncertain about my own answer, doesn't have markers to coordinatesthe point and find & memorize it carefully","use fingers to hold the coordinate, rotate/turn the board, use my fingers as guidance. lower myself to the height of the board to see the max/min height"
2D,102,extra pointer(cursor) on top of using my finger only. I can zoom in and zoom out. Hear confirmation on the practice round. I can navigate easily and see things clearly on the 2d. height is labeled to help with estimates,the picture loading in between each zoom in/out. It takes time away from me looking. I can't see if I zoom in the correct coord when zoomed in,use cursor as a extra marker on the coord. Use the number on the map to help finding the max/min
VR,102,"It was easy to move the graph around, easy to zoom in/out. I have two label points to help me find the coord (despite it doesn't temporary mark the coord). the lighting helps with the advert study. ","the scale was too hard to align with the graph (it should set that it can move up and down in a user-friendly way / stick the scale to the base of the the graph or something). Moving 3D is convenience, but not as easily as moving the object in person",use the cursor as a marker to help find the coordinates. Easily to zoom in
2D,103,The color of the map helped me a lot as it is easier to differentiate the elevation. ,The image took time to load and that gave me anxiety as the task is timed. ,Using the color as a general assessment of the elevation and then looking at the value of the lines.
VR,103,The 3D model helps make differentiate the height better. ,"The legion is hard to align with the map, making my answers less accurate. ",Zooming into the target area and pull the legion aside helped me a lot. 
Physical,103,I can manipulate the physical object easily and compare their height when looking at the side of it. ,I can not put the legion inside the target area to compare the height. ,Looking at the side of the physical model and compare the height of different spots. 
VR,104,Being able to visualize things in 3d and move them around to see from different angles made the tasks easier.,Inability to move the legend and the model together made it more difficult to measure in tasks 1 and 2. (The legend was not needed/helpful for task 3.),Magnifying to see things more closely for task 3. 
Physical,104,"Ability to move the model around very easily. Particularly useful for finding the lowest point and the ""ball rolling down the hill"" task.",The legend was very difficult to use for the range task. I felt limited by the fact that I couldn't place it through the model to actually measure.,None I can remember.
2D,104,Looking at numbers felt more precise than looking at a physical model.,Super cognitively demanding. My brain was working hard the entire time as none of the 2d viz elements were intuitive in the same way the 3d and physical models were.,No.
VR,105,The light in the virtual space being synced to the light in the physical space made it very intuitive to use the shine and shadows of the virtual model to try and get a gauge of its 3d shape despite being monochrome,"There was some tracking desync with the thumb button, so I only really used it to pinch for resizing, rather than using both hands to more precisely rotate it","Trying to trace out the path for the third section helped, and trying to align the legend within the 3d model helped with the first section"
2D,105,Being able to see the contour lines rather than trying to eyeball with a legend,"It took some time for it to re-render the map whenever I changed zoom levels or panned the viewport, and the map tended to ""jerk"" around when zooming out","Counting contour lines between labels for the elevation range & elevation comparison tasks, and tracing how ""tight"" the contour lines were for the advect task"
Physical,105,Having a tangible object to touch made the tracing/intersection task easier,"Downsides of the physical map, like the lack of topography labels, and not being able to ""clip"" the scale into it when it gets occluded by the edge",Tracing the path with my finger for the pathfinding task
Physical,106,The legend is helpful and the board has numbers and letters in both sides. I can rotate the model and make use of the lighting in the room to determine the relative altitude.,It's probably a me problem that I was not able to locate the specific point at the first place and the legend sometimes covers the letters and numbers which make me spend more time locating the point (this is probably an overhead?),"Although I didn't do it through all the trials, looking at the point from three views (front, left and top) helped identify the altitude. Again, the lighting in the physical environment helped a lot in the advection task. For finding the lowest point, paired-comparison will make it faster especially when the altitudes of the three points are different. "
VR,106,N/A,"The map and legend can't be decoupled as in the physical condition. It's also difficult for me to align the legend to the edge of the map to identify the altitude. When rotating or scaling the map, the legend doesn't go with the map, therefore extra time is needed to put the legend in a correct place. So I almost didn't use the bimanual interaction during the tasks and finish all them using my dominant hand instead.","I rotated the model to a certain view which makes me feel easy to finish the tasks, and spent more time observing it from that static view (i.e. not rotating frequently as I did in the physical condition). "
2D,106,"The mouse cursor helped locating the points when comparing the altitudes. The contour lines with numbers were super helpful for identifying the altitudes, and the colormap helped when zooming out the map.","The time for loading the map when zooming in and out is a bit longer (seems not running smoothly?). When the adjacent contour lines are far away, it's difficult to determine the ball direction.","Zoom out and check the color map, then zoom in for detailed comparison using numbers on the contour lines."
2D,107,The UI was user-friendly and easy to navigate. ,"The crosshairs were a little hard to notice if you don't pay much attention. The colors are kind of mixing to each other, making it quite hard to distinguish different elevations.",Paying attention to the indicated numbers and colors distribution are some ways to help me complete the tasks.
Physical,107,"The model was made meticulously, so that it is not very difficult to see the difference between two adjacent elevations (very high vs. very low).","The model was made entirely using one color so it is hard to tell when there is a small ""going-up"" in the middle of ""going-down"" if looking from top to bottom.",I turned the model around and position my eyes horizontally with the model in other to see clearly the two elevations
VR,107,The 3D model can be zoomed in and out freely which was very convenient to observe small details. The control was not so hard after using for a while.,The model was hard to control at first. The model was not standing still but moving around when my head moved. ,"Push and hold one control and only use the other one when I needed to zoom or rotate. Otherwise, one control is sufficient for me to observe the model."
Physical,108,The ability to physically manipulate and feel the model helped in these tasks,The fact that it was solid made estimating the height in the middle and the lowest point difficult since I had a harder time feeling it ,The strategy was to rely on my sense of touch to find the lowest and highest point and trace the path down the hill 
2D,108,The lines made it much easier determining height and steepness,The environment took a bit to load when zooming in and out which made it difficult to compare if I wanted to get in close,Counting rings helped for this test
VR,108,The ability to 3d zoom and manipulate both the scale and the map was helpful.,"There was no way to snap the scale to the map which made it difficult to line up, if I could do that, it would make most of the tasks easier and less frustrating.",I tried to line the scale up to the side and then move it into the model to better gauge height.
2D,109,-,-,-
VR,109,It can give more visualization confidence ,Initially bit difficult to use it the interactive graphics ,-
Physical,109,I was able to quickly identify points.,-,-
VR,110,ability to modify the model,"If the number bar were attached to the model, it would be easier ",need to do the comparison by looking at the bar
Physical,110,The difference between dataset ,No,Just tried to look more preciously 
2D,110,"In some tasks it was easier with the 2D model, like comparing based on the color","The numbers and letters were hidden at some point when zooming in and zooming out, and I was worried about the time",Following the perpendicular lines in downhill path was really helpful
VR,111,I think it is really easy to use the equipments(e.g. the pen) to zoom in to the point that I am interested in on the model.,"The legend didn't attach on the base (I could move it up and down), so I think it is hard for me to place it precisely and to locate the starting elevation.",Using both hands to manipulate the model to observe the point of interest.
2D,111,I could only use the counter lines and the colors on map to help me make the judgment.,"There were lots of information(lots of lines) on the map so it was hard to tell the answer within 1 minutes. Also, I only had a mouse with me so when I needed to compare 3 times, sometimes I forgot the location of a point when I found the next point.","Using the colors and lines on the map. When comparing 3 points, first compared the first two to avoid forgetting the location of any of them."
Physical,111,I could physically touch the model so I could feel the shape of it,"Sometimes it was hard to tell the difference when the difference of elevations between two points were really small, especially in the going down the hill task",Physically touch points of interest when eyes could not tell the difference.
Physical,112,-,-,Moving the model and look from different directions 
VR,112,-,The speed of moving could be faster ,Make the object larger 
2D,112,-,It was a bit slow,Using the color range first and then looking to the contours 
2D,113,the tasks weren't too difficult and they were easy to understand,"navigating the map was to difficult, so half the time was spent just getting right. ","there wasn't that much to it, so no"
Physical,113,The legend was somewhat useful in figuring out the highest/lost points in the circle when the point was on the edge.,The accuracy  of the legend being tied to it being on the edge of the map,Tracing the path of steepest descent was easier if you traced it by hand.
VR,113,The images of the map were high fidelity. They resembled the physical maps. ,"The tools used to interact with the map were hard to get used to, picking up the map and the legend were really hard",none
Physical,114,the legend helps,no,use fingers and tools
2D,114,no,the number on the contour pictures are not enough,look at the darkest and brightest colors
VR,114,no,it's hard to manipulate and the legend is also hard to align the bottom of the board,tried different angles
2D,115,I absolutely loved being able to easily zoom in/out with the scroll wheel and being able to pan through the map. I found this extremely helpful in being able to focus on the individual contour lines in a specified circle.  This was especially helpful in the advect task where it was important to note the closeness of lines to each other in addition to being able to make out the shapes of the contour lines so that it was easier to locate valleys.,The 2D interface itself did not have any significantly negative factors that took away from my experience.,"Across all of the tasks, being given the steepness color code was extremely useful. It allowed me to quickly locate the areas of interest on the map which reduced the time spent on the identification portion of the task.

For the range task, I would locate the specified circle and then compare the color gradients. If there were similar color gradients at different points on the circle, then I would look at the labelled contour lines in those regions and the number/density of contour lines that were between labelled lines. My strategy for the range task went through color gradient, labelled contour lines and then density of contour lines in order to complete the task.

For the compare task, I would locate the crosshairs of each of the three specified circles. I would then place a finger on each of those points so that it was easier to identify and thus compare the specified circles. After locating these circles, I similarly followed the process of looking at the color gradients, then continued to narrow down my answer by looking at the labelled contour lines.

The advect task was my LEAST favorite task and I'm no very confident in the strategy I used to accomplish it. I first placed my cursor on the center of the crosshairs and then looked around the edges of the circle to narrow down which quadrant the final answer could be in based off of the color gradient. After getting an idea of where my destination might be, I looked at each contour line one at a time as I got further out in the circle. The next step in my descent was determined by how closeness of the next contour line to my current point and if that point followed a v-formation. This v-formation was super important to keep in mind because this shape indicated that there was a valley at that spot."
VR,115,It was very convenient to be able to rotate the model around and actual see the difference in elevation.,"I did not like this one bit, there were many things that made me sad. I didn't like that the model and scale were separate so if you moved one, you had to move the other and it lost it's alignment. I didn't like that you couldn't tell if you had the proper alignment for the scale. ",-
Physical,115,I liked being able to actually touch the model and feel for myself where the grooves were. It definitely made the advect task very easy compared to the other modalities. ,The range task was so hard because the scale could only be used accurately on the edges of the model. It was also a definite drawback to not have the contour line labels.,-
VR,116,i think that it was a very cool and interesting thing! i think i could play with it for hours given the chance,it was a little wonky to mess with the more zoomed it was but it was good overall,pulling and zooming in as well as spinning the model on its side and looking from the top down
Physical,116,it was nice to feel the physical model ,it was harder to use the legend because it could be moved inside the model,drawing an imaginary line connecting the two points and praying it is correct 
2D,116,the lines with the meters were nice and the colors indicating height,it took the model a bit to load one you zoomed in or out that slowed me dow,narrowing it down by how the points were positioned on the map
VR,117,having easy to use indicators if i was in the box to move the model,"when i zoomed into the model, parts were cut off. i thought the 3d aspect of this would make it come out of the screen more",no
2D,117,the contour lines and color helped a lot,it took a while for the program to reload the x and y axis so i had to wait a bit in between ,the closer the lines the more slope it had 
Physical,117,having the physical model let me see the perspective and angle exactly how i wanted,no factors,using my finger to align with the scale 
Physical,118,terrain was well made. Looked visually appealing,none,"for lowest of 3 points. compared two points at a time and kept the lowest of the two. For advent, pictured water flowing when dropped at the middle."
VR,118,There was a cool factor to the VR. I had to stop myself from playing around with the set.,The pen tip and cursor (left and right hand) didn't line up completely.,Looking from different angles helped greatly.
2D,118,It was fun to use the topographic style map again. its been a while for me.,sometimes the numbers and letters didn't show up so i had to wait for them,I used the shading to picture what the landscape looked like for the advent. I pictured it as a smoothly changing slope.
2D,119,"The high ""magnification"" on the zoom, and the colors helped","The grid on the map was sometimes hard to stay in line with, making the multi-point task slightly difficult at first","Using my fingers to ""pinpoint"" locations on the map, or to visualize the ball in the final task"
Physical,119,"It was much easier to pick out locations with my fingers, and feel the differences in height between them.",It was much harder to compare the legend on the side to heights on the map,"Moving my chair so my viewing angle could be flat with the table, and looking straight down onto the model to see the graph clearly helped. Also using my fingers helped again."
VR,119,"Being able to ""phase"" my hand through the model helped a lot with more accurately tracking the ball rolling down the hill. Also, being able to see it from every angle also helped","it was much more difficult to use the elevation legend in the vr task, as there was no way to make sure it was 100% flat and sitting on the model correctly, as it would just phase through it,","Looking at all the points through multiple angles helped me quite a lot, as I could really get a ""feel"" for the landscape much more accurately than the map or the model"
Physical,120,ability to move/manipulate/touch interface,Difficulty in measuring elevation for points not on the edge of the map,moving my perspective/manipulating the model
2D,120,"ability to zoom, color coding, labels on map","Frequent reloading of map, and tendency for labels to not display",panning to only the area of interest
VR,120,ability to move scale within the model,"inability to lock things to planes (or keep scale and model on same plane), trouble manipulating objects",re-checking answers
2D,121,The pan and zoom functionality helped,In the comparison task it was a bit mentally demanding to keep track of 3 different elevations,Nothing specific
VR,121,It was easier to read the actual map compared to the contour plot.,"The legend moved independently from the map, and it was difficult to estimate the exact height in the map far away from the legend",Zoomed in as much as I could
Physical,121,"The physical model made it easier to physically interact (place my fingers, view around, etc.)",It was difficult to compare or estimate heights which were at similar heights.,Placed my fingers on the model and compared the touch sensation when required.
VR,122,Being able to rotate the model pretty consistently was good.,I had a hard time at first just figuring out how to not zoom; I kind of just started hitting all the buttons at first before I realized that the sensor was actually pretty sensitive and I could move more naturally.,"For the ""ball rolling"" and ""finding the lowest point"" tasks, I found it helpful if I moved the model so that I was looking at it from a top-down point of view. I also did that for the first task but I found that it didn't help that much."
Physical,122,"Manipulating the model/scale felt pretty easy to do, since I was very aware that the model would move how I wanted it to.","When trying to find the highest and lowest points in the circle, the scale being stuck to the ends of the model (in order to be the most accurate) felt kind of annoying. I felt like I couldn't get the most accurate read on the elevations.","To find the points of elevation, I liked to put myself at an even level with the model and look straight across to find the highest and lowest points. For the other two tasks, I preferred a top-down view of the model."
2D,122,I liked seeing the colors that showed the elevation.,"It was kind of hard to see what numbers were on the label with the different elevation colors. Also, if I zoomed in too far I kind of lost a sense for the different elevations and had to zoom out again. I also tended to zoom in too far the first time and had to keep readjusting the zoom.","I focused on the colors a lot; they helped me tell the different elevations. For the ball rolling, I looked for a ""v"" shape in the contour lines and followed those."
VR,123,The pen was very responsive so it was nice to use,The other hand thing was very off and I almost never used it other than for zooming in,Just looking at it from different angles mainly
2D,123,"Intuitive design such as moving, scrolling, etc",None,elevation line levels
Physical,123,None,None,the key/level when needed and just visualization
Physical,124,The tasks were engaging/challenging similar to a game.,"The size of the physical model and the lack of other resources. I wanted to find the ""right"" answer but only had limited data to work from.",For the first two tasks the scale was an important tool. I used my fingers to try to judge the heights/depths of the model
VR,124,Being able to zoom and move the legend within the model was a positive experience that made me think I was getting closer to more accurate answers.,"I was not experienced with manipulating the VR model and felt my strategies evolving throughout the test. It was particularly challenging to not be confident of how to get the legend to ""lie flat"" to assure an accurate estimate. I wanted a 'snap to' function so I could move the legend throughout the model but without losing the accuracy of the scale.","It took me time to leverage being able to zoom closely and essentially move within the model. I feel like over time I could be more accurate with the VR model, but it requires learning and technique whereas the physical model was intuitive for me."
2D,124,The contour lines gave me confidence that I was comparing accurate data. ,When points were close it was difficult to estimate their heights. The Advect test was very challenging. It was also difficult to scroll and zoom into the model and was sometimes laggy. ,For the hi/lo and find the lowest point I could estimate each point and that gave me strong confidence about my answers. The Advect test I felt much less confident that I was accurately assessing the pathway.
2D,125,"Being able to click, drag, point, and zoom with the mouse helped a lot. ",Sometimes the Letters and Numbers on the sides of the grids didn't render/load right away so I would have to wait a few seconds for those to pop up before I could figure out where to go on the map.,"Using the entire map to figure out the elevation of the points I had to guess. So like if I had to find the elevation for circle D9, I would look at D8, C9, E9, etc., to try and get a better understanding of the elevation of D9. Basically using ""context clues"""
Physical,125,Being able to hold and move the map in 3D space helped be line up the elevations with the legend.,"Some of the lower elevations were ""deep"" within the map so it was hard to line up with the legend.","Move the map around in 3D space to get a better idea of how elevations lined up with the legend. Imagine how the ball would fall down the hill and trace where its going, since its a physical 3D map it is easier to imagine the ball falling rather than to use math."
VR,125,Virtual Space made it very easy to move around both the map and legend.,"Controls had a bit of a learning curve. Needing to move my hands in 3D space to rotate the objects took a bit of figuring out. The 3D glasses moved the objects around a bit so sometimes I would line up everything but then it ""shifts"" as I move my head. Didn't stay still like the physical map did. Anytime I clipped the legend into the map, the software would have a hard time figuring out what object I was trying to grab.","""Clipping"" the legend through the map helped me line up the elevations exactly with the legend so it felt easier to determine what the elevations were. Similar to the physical map, there were shadows on the virtual model and I was able to use those to figure out highest vs lowest elevations without using the legend. "
